<P><h3>Description</h3></P>

<P>Caesar salad is a timeless dish known for its crisp romaine lettuce, crunchy croutons, and rich, creamy dressing. The dressing is typically made with garlic, anchovies, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce, blended with olive oil and mayonnaise for a smooth, savory flavor. Parmesan cheese adds a sharp, nutty note, balancing the dressing’s tanginess. Tossed together, these ingredients create a satisfying mix of textures and flavors: cool, crisp lettuce, cheesy and savory dressing, and crunchy croutons. Caesar salad is often enjoyed as a side but can also be topped with grilled chicken or shrimp for a heartier meal.</P>
