<p><h3>Description</h3></p>
<p>Korean fried chicken is a popular dish known for its <strong>ultra-crispy</strong>, crackling exterior and juicy, flavorful meat. Unlike traditional fried chicken, it's often double-fried, giving it an exceptionally crisp coating that stays crunchy, even when tossed in sauce. The chicken pieces are coated in a thin batter, fried once to cook the meat, and then fried again to add a light, shatteringly crisp crust. It’s commonly glazed with a sweet and spicy sauce made from ingredients like gochujang (Korean red chili paste), soy sauce, garlic, and sugar, balancing heat and sweetness. Korean fried chicken is typically garnished with sesame seeds and green onions and often served with pickled radish, making it an addictive snack or meal that’s beloved worldwide.</p>

<p><h3>Directions</h3></p>
<ol>

<li>Slowly add the cold water to the dry ingredients, whisking until you have a smooth batter.</li>
