<p><h3>Description</h3></p>
<p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of flat, wide pasta sheets, often alternating with rich 
    fillings like ground meat (typically beef or pork), tomato sauce, and a creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese mixture. 
    Each layer builds up a hearty, flavorful combination, often enhanced with Italian herbs like basil, oregano, and garlic. 
    The top is finished with a generous sprinkle of mozzarella or Parmesan cheese, which melts and browns to create a deliciously golden crust when baked. 
    Lasagna is known for its comforting, cheesy, and savory flavor profile, making it a favorite at gatherings and family dinners.</p>

        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cans canned tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
        <li>1/2 cup water</li> <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        
        
    </ul></p>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
